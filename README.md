Defents mission system

Stuff is not always working as it should. This works but you will need to have some knowledge on how to
execute files serverside in Arma 3.

Contains two MAAIN twst missions. No array for side missions at the moment. Will be added later. 

Missions should spawn AI. To keep ai staying, unquote the last part. Should keep them active and up for 4 hours.


WHAT DOES THIS NOT HAVE AND WHATS IN DEVELOPMENT:

- Proper cleanup
- Mission finish trigger
- Other stuff
